## How to build and install

_Latest zig version supported: 0.15.0-dev.263+d8153fa74_

### Requirements
- Since this is built with Zig, you should be able to build buzz on a wide variety of architectures even though this has only been tested on x86/M1.
- Linux or macOS (Windows support [is coming](https://github.com/buzz-language/buzz/issues/74))
- libc
- zig master

### Build
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/buzz-language/buzz <buzz_dir>`
2. Checkout submodules: `git submodule update --init`
3. Have fun: `zig build run -- <myscript.buzz>` to run a script  or `zig build run` to start the REPL

### Install

```bash
# install locally at ~/.local
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install -p ~/.local

# install globally at /usr/local
sudo zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install -p /usr/local
```

If you're usage if performance critical (game dev for example), you can build using `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`.

Remember to modify PATH to include the `bin` directory where it is installed. For example, `export PATH=PATH:/home/xxx/.local/bin`. You can then run buzz with `buzz <myscript.buzz>`. Or you can simply run `buzz` to start the REPL.
